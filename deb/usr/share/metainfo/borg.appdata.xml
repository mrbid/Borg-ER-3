	<summary>A portable (SDL) audio synthesizer / tone generator inspired by the Korg ER-1</summary>
	<description>
		<p>This is fixed-state modular synthesizer using FART oscillators, which if you can hold back the chuckles for just a moment stands for Frequency, Amplitude, Resolution, and Transformation oscillators, where the resolution regards harmonic resolution and transformation regards which wave-shape is being produced by the oscillator.</p>
		<p>The envelope can be clicked and dragged into any shape, and the biquads can be manually configured on a per coefficient basis, they are executed in sequential order so BIQUAD 1 executes first.</p>
