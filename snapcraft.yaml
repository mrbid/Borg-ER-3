version: '0.85'
summary: A tone generator inspired by the Korg ER-1
description: |
  This is fixed-state modular synthesizer using FART oscillators, which if you can hold back the chuckles for just a moment stands for Frequency, Amplitude, Resolution, and Transformation oscillators, where the resolution regards harmonic resolution and transformation regards which wave-shape is being produced by the oscillator.

  The envelope can be clicked and dragged into any shape, and the biquads can be manually configured on a per coefficient basis, they are executed in sequential order so BIQUAD 1 executes first.

  It's a fun little synthesizer and a spiritual reboot of the original Borg ER-2 which is a windows application: https://github.com/mrbid/Borg-ER-2
